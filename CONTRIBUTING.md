Thank you for your interest in improving the Firefish Protocol! We welcome feedback and suggestions from the community. This document provides guidelines for making contributions.

## Important Licensing Information

Please note that the Firefish Protocol source code is distributed under a proprietary, source-available license. The full license text can be found in the [LICENSE](/LICENSE.md) file.

## How Can I Contribute?

If you have an idea for an improvement, a suggestion, a bug fix, or a new feature, the correct way to share it is by opening an **Issue** or by creating a **Pull Request**. To ensure a smooth collaboration, please follow these guidelines to decide whether to open an issue first or to submit a pull request directly.

### **Opening an Issue**

You should open an issue before starting work if you plan to make a significant change. This allows us to discuss the proposed change and ensure it aligns with the project's goals before you invest a lot of time in the work. This is a great way to get feedback on your approach.

Please open an issue for:

- Major new features.
- Significant architectural changes or refactoring.
- Complex bug fixes that may require discussion.

When you open an issue, please provide a clear and detailed description of your suggestion. This may include:

- A description of the problem or the proposed enhancement.
- The specific part of the code your suggestion relates to.
- Examples or small code snippets to illustrate your idea.

### Creating a Pull Request

For small or obvious fixes, you are welcome to create a pull request directly without opening an issue first.

Good candidates for direct pull requests include:

- Typo corrections in code or documentation.
- Fixing obvious bugs that have a clear and simple solution.
- Minor improvements to documentation.

Please follow the standard GitHub "Fork and Pull Request" workflow.

1. **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a **new branch** for your changes (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`).
4. Make your changes, then **commit** them with a clear commit message.
5. **Push** your branch to your fork on GitHub.
6. Open a **Pull Request** from your fork's branch to our `main` branch.

## Your Contribution License Grant

Our project uses a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) to manage code contributions. This ensures that the project has the necessary rights to all contributed code while allowing you to retain full ownership of your work.

**By submitting any contribution to this project—whether through a Pull Request, an Issue, or any other means—you agree that your contribution is licensed to us under the terms of our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](/legal/ICLA.md).**

You don't need to do anything in advance. When you open your first pull request, our CLA Assistant bot will automatically post a comment with a link to review and sign the agreement. This is a simple, one-time process. For all other contributions, this notice serves as the basis of the agreement.

**Why do we need this?**
The CLA is a standard legal document used by many projects. It protects both you as the contributor and us as the project maintainer. It clarifies the intellectual property rights for your contribution, ensuring that Firefish Labs has the necessary rights to incorporate your work into the project while allowing you to retain full ownership of your contribution.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in helping us maintain a clear and secure legal framework for the project.
