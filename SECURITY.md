# Security Policy

The Firefish team takes the security of our software and platform very seriously. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the community in helping us maintain a secure environment.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Firefish team welcomes security reports and is grateful for your efforts to disclose vulnerabilities responsibly.

To ensure the confidentiality of your finding, we strongly prefer that you submit reports via GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature. This is the most secure and efficient way to reach our team.

1.  Go to the "Security" tab of our GitHub repository: [https://github.com/Firefish-io/firefish-protocol/security](https://github.com/Firefish-io/firefish-protocol/security)
2.  Click the "Report a vulnerability" button.

While GitHub's private reporting is the preferred method, you can also contact us for security-related matters at [security@firefish.io](mailto:security@firefish.io).
