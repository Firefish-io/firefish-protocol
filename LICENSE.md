### 1. Preamble: The Purpose of this License

This license is designed to provide transparency to the users of the Firefish platform. We are providing you with the source code for our WebAssembly (WASM) module used for the non-custodial escrow of Bitcoin collateral. This allows you to personally verify that the code running in your browser is secure and functions as intended and to use it to interact with our platform as intended. The rights granted are limited to these specific purposes. Please note that this is not an open-source license. Unless specifically stated otherwise, this license does not permit any commercial use of the Licensed Work, nor the reuse of the Licensed Work or any part thereof in other works.

### 2. Grant of Rights (What You CAN Do)

The Licensor grants you the following licenses:

**(A) General Revocable License:** A non-exclusive, world-wide, non-transferable, royalty-free, revocable, limited license for the following purposes:

- a. To download, verify, and compile the Licensed Work.
- b. To perform personal testing and debugging in a local environment.
- c. To use the Licensed Work to interact with the Official Platform.
- d. To suggest improvements to the Licensor (pull requests).

**(B) Irrevocable Emergency License:** A non-exclusive, world-wide, non-transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable license for the following specific purposes:

- e. To archive the code indefinitely for disaster recovery.
- f. To use the code to recover bitcoins stuck in the smart contract by accident, if and only if such recovery is in agreement with the terms of the contract itself.

### 3. Restrictions (What You CANNOT Do)

You are expressly prohibited from doing any of the following, except as explicitly permitted under the Irrevocable Emergency License (Section 2.B):

- a. Use with Other Platforms: Modifying the Licensed Work to circumvent its need to communicate with the Official Platform, or using it to interact with any backend service other than the Official Platform.
- b. Build a Competing Service: Using the Licensed Work, in whole or in part, to create a product or service that offers bitcoin-backed loans or any other functionality that competes with the Official Platform.
- c. Redistribute: Distributing, publishing, sublicensing, selling, or otherwise making the Licensed Work, or any modified version of it, available to any third party. To avoid any doubt, suggesting improvements to the Licensor under Article 2(d) (pull request) does not violate this clause or qualify as redistribution of the licensed work.
- d. Remove Notices: Removing or altering any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices contained within the Licensed Work.
